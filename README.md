# AMAS written project: Classification of pulsars from the High Time Resolution Universe survey

This Project focuses on using a method or statistical treatment that is hopefully related to your field of research that you or your group select.

The only hand-in is a 4-5 page written report. You can submit the code as well if you would like. The project should be formatted and written as if it were a conference proceeding or journal article: Abstract, introduction, formatted figures w/ captions, citations, etc...
